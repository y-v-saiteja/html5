        <h3> Introduction to HTML</h3>
        HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. 
        HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap,
        different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or
      act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink
     to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
    </p>
    
    <h3> Anatomy of HTML Elements</h3>
    <p>
       <b> The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
       <br> <b> closing tag: </b>This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
       <br><b> content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
       <br><b> element:</b> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
